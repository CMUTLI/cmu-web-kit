# Carnegie Mellon Web Kit

The Carnegie Mellon Web Kit (`cmu-web-kit`) builds on Carnegie Mellon's web
template with components for a unified look across Cascade sites and the web
apps around them: path cards, callouts, testimonials, embedded pages, status
pills, tabs, dialogs, file drop zones, bulk selection bars, copy buttons, and
more. It works alongside the template without changing how it looks.

**Documentation and live examples: https://cmutli.github.io/cmu-web-kit/**

## Three Files

- `css/cmu-cms.css`: page components, for the CMS and apps alike
- `css/cmu-app.css`: app components, loaded after `cmu-cms.css`
- `js/cmu-app.js`: behavior for the components that need it, such as copy
  buttons

## Add It to the CMS

In Cascade, add this line to the text block your site's `setup` block puts
in the head, above your site's own stylesheet:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/CMUTLI/cmu-web-kit@0.1.0/css/cmu-cms.css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
```

Then paste components into a content section's Source code view. The
[Get Started](https://cmutli.github.io/cmu-web-kit/docs/start.html) page
walks through it step by step.

## Add It to an App

In the page's `<head>`, link CMU's template first, then the kit, then your
own stylesheet:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<link href="https://www.cmu.edu/common/standard-v6/css/main.6.7.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/CMUTLI/cmu-web-kit@0.1.0/css/cmu-cms.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/CMUTLI/cmu-web-kit@0.1.0/css/cmu-app.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="/css/your-app.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

The kit's script goes just before `</body>`, after the template's scripts:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/CMUTLI/cmu-web-kit@0.1.0/js/cmu-app.js"></script>
```

For an app in production, keep your own copy of a release instead; the
[Get Started](https://cmutli.github.io/cmu-web-kit/docs/start.html) page
shows how for Node and other stacks.

## Versions

Every link names an exact version, so your pages never change until you
choose to move to a newer one. See the
[releases](https://github.com/CMUTLI/cmu-web-kit/releases) for what each
version changed.

## About

The Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning Innovation built the
kit while rewriting the Syllabus Registry. Each component starts from a real
CMU page that already does it well; the
[About](https://cmutli.github.io/cmu-web-kit/docs/about.html) page has more.

## License

`LICENSE`), copyright Carnegie Mellon University. It doesn't cover:

- **Carnegie Mellon's names and marks**, including the Scotty image in
  `docs/images/scotty.png` (the Scotty chatbot's avatar). The license grants
